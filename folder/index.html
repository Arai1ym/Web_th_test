    Sherlock is a British crime television series based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective stories.
    Created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes
    and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson. Thirteen episodes have been produced,
    with four three-part series airing from 2010 to 2017 and a special episode that aired
    on 1 January 2016. The series is set in the present day, while the one-off special
    features a Victorian period fantasy resembling the original Holmes stories.
    Sherlock is produced by the British network BBC, along with Hartswood Films,
    with Moffat, Gatiss, Sue Vertue and Rebecca Eaton serving as executive producers.
    The series is supported by the American station WGBH-TV Boston for its
    Masterpiece anthology series on PBS, where it also airs in the United States.</p>
